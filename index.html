        <h2>About TEDxSanLuisObispo</h2>
         <p>TED is a global nonprofit organization devoted to helping people better understand the world through “Ideas Worth Spreading”. The first TED conference debuted in 1984 where people from the Technology, Entertainment and Design industries converged to share their ideas.</p>
         <p>The TEDxSanLuisObispo team is a group of passionate young leaders dedicated to the pursuit of learning, development, and positive change in their community. We are excited to bring the TEDx experience to San Luis Obispo and share the unique ideas and insight of SLO citizens with TED. With a strong platform for individuals to share their visions, we can create a one of a kind experience with a huge impact. Our annual conference unites the local community and Cal Poly students together, presenting topics that educate and inspire citizens to become catalysts for improvement and change. </p>

        <h2>Sponsorship Opportunities</h2>
         <p>TEDx was created in the spirit of TED’s mission with a goal to give communities, organizations, and individuals the opportunity to stimulate dialogue and create change through TED experiences at the local level. TEDx events are created and organized by TED enthusiasts within their own communities and are designed to present ideas that are of specific interest to that community, in our case, San Luis Obispo. TEDx features a combination of live presenters and official TEDTalks aimed at sparking intellectual conversation and discussion, while uniting community members behind common ideals. 
</p>
         <p>We encourage you to consider partnering with or sponsoring us to bring TEDxSanLuisObispo to the community.
